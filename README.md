# Simple weather app for intro to Javascript class

## Description

This is a basic weather app for the intro to Javascript class taught by Adam LeBlanc.

The css and html were taken from the [PWA code](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/) lab by google.

## Setup

### Cloning

You must first clone the code to your VM.

1. Open the terminal and type the following commands
2. `cd Workspaces`
3. `git clone https://github.com/AdamLeBlanc/javascriptClass_weather-app.git`
4. `cd javascriptClass_weather-app.git`
5. `code .` (this will open code, go back to the terminal)
6. `live-server .`
7. **Ready to go!**

### API KEY

You will need your own API key for this to work. The one we used in class is deactivated and will no longer work.

To do this make an account at openweathermap.org.

After you have done this, find the API key section, and copy your key or make one if it is not available.

In the app.js file, replace <Your API KEY HERE> on line 20 with your API key.

Now you're ready to go! We will do more with the code in class.
